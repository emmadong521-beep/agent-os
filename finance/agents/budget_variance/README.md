# Budget Variance & Business Insight Agent

The Budget Variance Agent helps finance teams analyze budget execution and generate management-ready business insight reports.

## Goals

- Compare budget vs actual data
- Attribute variances to business drivers
- Detect abnormal items and material deviations
- Generate structured management reports
- Support memory writeback in the future for recurring variance patterns, risk signals, and recommended actions

## MVP Flow

1. Ingest structured budget vs actual data.
2. Classify revenue, cost, and expense items.
3. Identify major favorable and unfavorable variances.
4. Attribute variances using business drivers and remarks.
5. Produce a Chinese management report using the report template.

## v1.2 CSV Loader

v1.2 adds a standard-library CSV loader for budget actual data. It validates required fields, parses numeric values, supports percentage or decimal variance rates, and converts rows into structured finance data objects.

Run the demo from the repository root:

```bash
python3 finance/agents/budget_variance/demo_load_budget_data.py
```

## v1.3 Rule-Based Analyzer

v1.3 adds a rule-based analyzer that classifies material variance items by direction, severity, and category, summarizes results by department and category, and emits Chinese insight flags for management review.

Run the analyzer demo from the repository root:

```bash
python3 finance/agents/budget_variance/demo_analyze_budget_variance.py
```

## v1.4 Markdown Report Renderer

v1.4 adds a rule-based Chinese Markdown renderer that converts `BudgetVarianceSummary` into a management-readable budget execution variance report.

Run the report demo from the repository root:

```bash
python3 finance/agents/budget_variance/demo_render_budget_report.py
```

## v1.5 Local Web UI and Skill

v1.5 adds a Streamlit UI for CSV upload, threshold configuration, KPI cards, major variance tables, insight flags, Markdown report display, and report download. It also adds a Budget Variance Skill definition under `finance/skills/budget_variance`.

Run the UI from the repository root:

```bash
streamlit run apps/budget_variance_ui.py
```
